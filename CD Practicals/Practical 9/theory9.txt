Aim :-
Write a C program to optimize the 3-address code generated.

Tools :-
1. Compiler ; Specification :- Computer (any), Turbo C, C++ of GEC
2. Computer System ; Specification :- 4 GB RAM, Windows 1 TB HDD ; Quantity :- 1

Theory :-
3 address code :- It is a type of intermediate code which is easy to generate and can be easily converted to machine code. It makes use of at most address and one computed at each instruction is sorted in temporary variable generated by compiler.

3 address code optimization :- 3 address code is often used as an intermediate representation of code during optimization phases of the compilation process. The 3-address code allows the compiler to analyze the code perform optimization that can improve the performance of the generated code.

C Program :-

Conclusion :-
Program in C program to optimize the 3-address code generated is successfully executed.
