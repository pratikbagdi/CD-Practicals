Aim :-
Design a program to evaluate postfix expression.

Tools :-
1. C Compiler ; Specification :- Turbo C, acc, any
2. Computer System ; Specification :- Windows, 4 GB RAM ; Quantity:- 1

Theory :-
Postfix Notation: way of writing arithmetic expressions in which each operation follow it’s operands
e.g., “ 3 + 4 ” => “ 3 4 + ”
Set Steps to evaluate postfix expression i.e., " 3 4 + "
=>Scan expression from left to right : 
- push 3 onto stack ( stack : 3 )
- push 4 onto stack ( stack : 4 )
- pop 3 and 4 from stack add them together ( 3 + 4 = 7 ) and push the result (i.e., 7) back onto stack
Return expression present at the top of stack which is 7.

Lex Program :-

C Program :-

Conclusion :-
The program to evaluate postfix expression designed successfully.
