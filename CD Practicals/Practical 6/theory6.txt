Aim :-
Design a program for basic calculator using YACC or BISON.

Tools :-
1. Compile ; Specification :- YACC OF BISON
2. Computer System ; Specification :- Windows, 4 GB RAM, 1 TB HDD ; Quantity :- 1

Theory :-
YACC ( Yet Another Compiler Compiler ) & BISON are tool that generate parsers ( Programs analyze structure of text on code ) based on formal design of language grammar commonly used in development of compilers, interpreters & other language based software.
Syntax â€“ 
% {
    //declaration section.
% }
% %
% token definition
    grammar declaration
% %
int main ( ) {
yy parse ( ); 
return 1;
}

Lex Program :-

Conclusion :-
The program for basic calculator using YACC or BISON designed successfully.
